Things to do
============

3. Add forward,backward
4. wflux calculation + temp, salt
6. is there an index-1 problem?
7. What do freesurface & varbottombox do?
8. Fix tracer writing

Code description
================

Main time loop has counter ints. This loops from intstart to intstart+intrun. intstart is set in main.f95 depending on whether you've asked for forward / backward integration.

readfield.f9x must set ncTpos (time slice for nc reading) to read in time-dependent fields.


Loop Labels
===========

intsTimeLoop = main time loop
|	     - ints = intstart + 1 : intstart+intrun
|
----> nTracLoop    = loop over different trajectories
      |		   - ntrac = 1:ntractot
      |
      ----> niterLoop    = ode solver loop for each trajectory?

Variable Descriptions
=====================
NOT MODIFIED = same in khedstrom's version

ints 	     = main time loop counter goes from intstart to intstart+intrun
intstart     = intmin (forward) or intmin+intrun (backward) - main.f95
intrun	     = (run file)
intmin	     = (run file)
intmax	     = input from grid file (init_par) | NOT SURE IF USED
intend	     = intmax (forward), intmin (backward) - main.f95 | NOT SURE IF USED
intspin	     = (run file) trajectory release period | particles are released when ints <= intstart+intspin 
intstep      = (run file) pos if forward, neg if backward
intrpg 	     = time interpolation constant (?)
intrpr       = 1 - intrpg (?)

niter	     = loop counter for ODE solver? called once per trajectory
	     = This is written to *_run.asc file
ntime	     = ? - used for seeding it tst1 < ntime < tst2
	     = I've set this to ints in seed.f95
ncTpos	     = defines which time slice to use in the netcdf file.

Following from comment.f95
--------------------------
ds          = dt/(dx*dy*dz) Units in (s/m**3)
dsmin	    = dtmin/(dx*dy*dz) Units in (s/m**3)
tt          = ints*tseas - time in seconds of the trajectory relative to the code start

dt 	    - time step of trajectory iteration in seconds
	    = dtmin * floor(tt/tseas * iter) + 1 - tt/tseas * iter
	    = I think this is for the ODE solver

tseas	    = ngcm * 3600 = time between velocity fields - NOT MODIFIED
dtmin  	    = tseas / iter =  iterative time step in seconds - NOT MODIFIED
timax       = max time duration of trajectory (specified in run file) then converted to seconds in init_par


Rebecca Dell's notes
====================

FILES:

Compile after Changing:
Outer Makefile - Set Project
      	       - Set Case
Inner Makefile - Usually no changes required
setupgrid      - L52: name of grid file (grid.nc) 
readfield      - L64: name of velocity file (vel.nc)
	       - L67: nctpos set the timestep to calculate trajectories

No Compilation Needed:
run.in	       - L8: casename
	       - L56: twritetype=2 saves time as Julian date, I usually 
	         use twritetype=0
	       - L63: set how often to write out the trajectory locations
	       - L66: directory containing vel.nc
	       - L69: directory to write out the resulting run.asc file
	       - L72: name of output file
	       - L75: intmininoutfile: if 1, adds starting time to output 
	       	 filename; if 0 leaves output filename alone
	       - L123+: locations to initialize particles
	       - L168: set the diffusion parameters if using a 
	         sub-grid-scale parameterization (-Dturb or -Ddiffusion in the 
		 inner makefile)
	       - LAST SECTION: location to kill particles
	       - Also other options to set about the density and 
	       	 distribution of particles

grid.in	       - L10: name of grid.nc file
	       - L12: description of run
	       - L18+: size of grid, should be (L+1, M+1, N) in ROMS terms
	       - L31: timestep between GCM steps--not exactly sure how this
	       	 works.  Since I'm using stationary velocities, I don't 
		 think this matters in physical terms.  However, with 
		 kriva = 1 (run.in, L63), this is the timestep used to 
		 output the particle locations, so I think 
		 I can adjust this if I want more or fewer timesteps output.

Data files:
grid.nc	       - easiest to just copy this into the project file
	       - make sure it has a mask_rho field--my newer grids all 
	         include this automatically, but older grid files might 
		 require it to be added--it's just ones everywhere
vel.nc	       - copy this into the the project file, too


Compilation
===========

1. Comment out return at end of main.f95

2. Assign ARG_INT1 = intmin & ARG_INT2 = intrun in Makefile.global - based on bror's compilation.
   Update: This is fixed by making sure there's a proper Makefile in the projects/*** subfolder. 
   Kate's version expects Makefile.prj; Bror's version expects Makefile

3. Undefined reference to interp_ means that tempsalt hasn't been defined. interp.f95 has code only
   if tempsalt is defined

4. commented out calls to z_w, z_r

5. ifort requires -Tf switch to consider .f95 files as FORTRAN 90 compliant.

6. commented out lines 91,102 in seed.f95
